# Social-Network-API

### This project uses Mongoose, Express.js, and MongoDB to store user data which contains username, email, and saves thoughts, friends, as well as reactions. By giving these thoughts and users id's, we are able to keep track of who reacts to which thought and which people have certain friends. Below are links to VSCode and Insomnia for demonstrations.
